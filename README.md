This is the code to reproduce "Separation and denoising of seismically-induced signals with dual-path recurrent neural network architecture" paper 2020

For detailed and sequential description please refer to Source_Separation.ipynb (you may run it in your local environment, but the best and most optimal way would be to run it via Google Colaboratory)

For earthquake related applications please download the data from [the STEAD Dataset](https://github.com/smousavi05/STEAD) and adopt the notebooks accoringly to your data locations (as there is no automated way to download the data as of 18.11.2020)
